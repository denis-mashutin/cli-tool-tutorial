# Passphrase Generator
This repository contains the code of the basic [passphrase generator](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2023/05/create-passphrase-generator-in-pycharm/).

**You can download and use the word lists only for learning purposes, and at your own risk. Generating real passphrases based on these word lists is strongly discouraged.**
